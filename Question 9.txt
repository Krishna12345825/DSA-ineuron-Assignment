
Q9. What will the code below output to the console and why?

var arr1 = "john".split(''); 
var arr2 = arr1.reverse();
var arr3 = "jones".split('');
arr2.push(arr3);
console.log("array 1: length=" + arr1.length + " last=" + arr1.slice(-1));
console.log("array 2: length=" + arr2.length + " last=" + arr2.slice(-1));


Out Put will be : "array 1: length=5 last=j,o,n,e,s" "array 2: length=5 last=j,o,n,e,s"
"The reverse() method returns a reference to the array itself (i.e., in this case, arr1).
 As a result, arr2 is simply a reference to (rather than a copy of) arr1. Therefore, when anything is done to arr2 (i.e., when we invoke arr2.push(arr3);),
 arr1 will be affected as well since arr1 and arr2 are simply references to the same object."
